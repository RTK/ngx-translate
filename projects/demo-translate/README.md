#demo-translate

To run this demo application install all necessary dependencies via
```shell
$ npm install
```

Now you have to compile the translate library once. Execute

```shell
$ ng build
```
This should create the `dist` directory in the project root with the compiled library in it.

After that you can run the development server via

```
$ ng serve demo-translate
```

Now open a webbrowser of your choice and visit `http://localhost:4200`.
There we go!
